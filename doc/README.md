This project is mainly about sentiment analysis on presidents' inaugural speech. I want to know whether a president is more positive or more negative. By utilizing R package - sentiment, I chose three sentiments including positive, negative and neutral to see the percentile each sentiment accounts for in a speech. 

Generally, a president is more positive in his inaugural speech. However, there are two exceptional cases. One is James Madison on his second inaugural speech, the other is Abraham Lincoln on his second inaugural speech. These two turn out to be more negative cases. Thus, I take these two cases for deepen analysis to see if I can find something illuminating in these speeches.
